# DGFBot  [![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
This is bot for game **["Dream Girlfriend"](http://dreamgirlf.com/pc/?)** wrapped in an browser add-on (much more for mozilla on moment of developing).


We try to make an add-on that would do for you all boring things in game "Dream Girlfriend", borring things like: 
  - Daily likes
  - Spending all group points 
  - And much more.


### Technologies used
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Java Script
  - [Web API](http://dreamgirlf.com/pc/?)
  - [JavaScript APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API)
  - (and maybe that's all, dev'll see on the stage of programming)

### AHTUNG
Right now the bot isn't tested properly and it can give some errors at using. If you want, you can use it on your own risc.
And one more thing, the "Dream Girlfriend" **[Terms of Service](https://us-nizi2d-app.amz-aws.jp/pc_rule/?ste=1)** says clearly that quoting **"The use of bots, cheat tools or other
software to intentionally manipulate access to or cause damage to the Service and any related data."** are Forbidden Actions.

The bot itself isn't harming the site/service, it is just automatising boring tasks.

### Installation
Right now me (the dev) are a newbie and don't know properly how to compile and do those related thing for maintaining. If you user know about add-ons and want to try this extension you can try to load it as a **Temporary Add-on**
#### Post scriptum
  Hi, it's me the main dev of this thing, on this moment of developing i'm just learning the java script which leads to the fact that some of the bot scripts would be coded awfully and would cause bot to run slow. Feel free to help with coding or ideas
